<h1>Redirection</h1>
<div class="xmldoc">
<p>Functions have signature f :: params... -&gt; HttpContext -&gt; Async<unit> option.</p>

<p>Functions from here are 'end routes' in that they don't require you to keep
returning applicatives, but can end up in an async monad/workflow that writes
the data to the client in the end.</p>

<p>This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be
taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.  The action
required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction
with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is
GET or HEAD. A client SHOULD detect infinite redirection loops, since
such loops generate network traffic for each redirection.</p>
