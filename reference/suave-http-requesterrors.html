<h1>RequestErrors</h1>
<div class="xmldoc">
<p>10.4 Client Error 4xxThe 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the
 client seems to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request,
 the server SHOULD include an entity containing an explanation of the
 error situation, and whether it is a temporary or permanent
 condition. These status codes are applicable to any request method.
 User agents SHOULD display any included entity to the user.</p>

<p>If the client is sending data, a server implementation using TCP
 SHOULD be careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of
 the packet(s) containing the response, before the server closes the
 input connection. If the client continues sending data to the server
 after the close, the server's TCP stack will send a reset packet to
 the client, which may erase the client's unacknowledged input buffers
 before they can be read and interpreted by the HTTP application.</p>

<p>The request could not be completed due to a conflict with the current

information for the user to recognize the source of the conflict.
Ideally, the response entity would include enough information for the
user or user agent to fix the problem; however, that might not be
possible and is not required.</p>

<p>Conflicts are most likely to occur in response to a PUT request. For
example, if versioning were being used and the entity being PUT
included changes to a resource which conflict with those made by an
earlier (third-party) request, the server might use the 409 response
to indicate that it can't complete the request. In this case, the
response entity would likely contain a list of the differences
between the two versions in a format defined by the response
Content-Type.</p>

limited-time, promotional services and for resources belonging to
individuals no longer working at the server's site. It is not
necessary to mark all permanently unavailable resources as "gone" or
to keep the mark for any length of time -- that is left to the
discretion of the server owner.</p>
